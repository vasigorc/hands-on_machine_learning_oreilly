Exercises and examples from O'Reilly's "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TernsorFlow" by A. Geron (3rd ed.)

## Description

This repository is an accompanying journal on my path of going through examples and exercises from ["Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow"](https://www.amazon.ca/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1098125975/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38N00QAG38IJI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0Jm1bLoXUBA_cK-tar7HW1L7KzUCRFLa7mcRAFq-rLTjFvovU0-vJBQMzTURv4kIz7873GuN38RCcSP06ZFwPEAr4narzSgskAqqh4m2BCdfvOvHjEXN6nHdT6SCnDxb8dpaG1ry6YSeG1ez78MzlOgf3Nhf-Q1YNPn5JF_1laMUQtr6BI-sSz9SaIAii-dNKbtBEl9xtq7CrgwaI2iaiI3edXso3KcduUeBa3uAG7xnh0XiKAgLk_ClZUQYwly1icOOvbZ-dvlK4c88g2NAafKIWWqXja0xyho3m8o86fw.ZVOwAPQxI9PfqNFYoW5k53GPy89mH6wLPat9B7v2tos&dib_tag=se&keywords=hands-on+machine+learning+with+scikit-learn%2C+keras%2C+and+tensorflow&qid=1716585380&sprefix=hands-on+mac%2Caps%2C66&sr=8-1) book from o'Reilly.
It follows book's chapter division, partially for ease of navigation, but also due to the fact that different chapters
may require different environment set-up.

## Runbook

### Python projects

Please follow these steps to set-up and activate a local virtual environment:

1. `cd` inside the project of your choice
2. Set-up a virtual environment

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate your virtual environment (example below is for macOS/Linux)

    ```shell
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

To run Python file simply do (replace file reference to suit your case):

    ```shell
    python3 chapter_01/gdp_to_life_satisfaction/main.py
    ```
